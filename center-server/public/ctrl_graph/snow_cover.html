        Snow is precipitation that forms when water vapor freezes. Because snow is so reflective, it plays an important role in regulating climate: it reflects incoming sunlight back into space, cooling the planet. Snow also supports life. Melting of seasonal snow (as well as glaciers) provides water for drinking and irrigating crops in many parts of the world. Snowmelt moisturizes soil and reduces the risk of wildfire. Too much snow, however, can lead to springtime floods when the snowpack melts.
