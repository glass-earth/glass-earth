                    The Waldo Canyon fire is a forest fire that started 10 miles (16 km) northwest of Colorado Springs
                    on June 23, 2012, on July 8, 2012 the fire is 100 percent contained on 15,364 acres (24 sq mi; 62
                    km2) of US Forest Service land. The fire has caused the evacuation of over 32,000 residents of
                    Colorado Springs, Manitou Springs and Woodland Park, several small mountain communities along
                    Highway 24, and partial evacuation of the United States Air Force Academy. On the afternoon of June
                    26, winds increased following a dry thunderstorm that passed west of the fire, within two hours the
                    fire which had been held by firefighters near Rampart Road jumped northeast into Queens Canyon as
                    the fire crested out of Queens Canyon gusts as high as 70 mph pushed the fire down the front range
                    particularly into the Mountain Shadows neighborhood. After 12 hours of fighting the blaze in western
                    Colorado Springs the fire had claimed over 350 homes in Colorado Springs, thus making it the most
                    destructive fire in Colorado state history by the number of houses burned.
