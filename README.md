## Introduction

Glass Earth is solving the challenge "A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words" whose requirement is creating a "mashup" to combine data from various sources including satellite imagery from NASAâ€™s Global Imagery Browse Services ([GIBS](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/GIBS/GIBS+Available+Imagery+Products)) and other reliable sources, finding the connection among them. Combining information like this can put data into context to tell a compelling story or unearth an interesting insight.

### Prerequisites

Glass Earth uses these tools & SDKs:

1. **[Unity Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/)**
* **[Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk)**
* **[Leap Motion SDK](https://www.leapmotion.com/developers)**
* **[JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase)**
* **[Go 1.2](http://golang.org)**

### Structure

1. **[EarthModelUnity (Unity App)](https://github.com/glass-earth/glass-earth/tree/master/EarthModelUnity)**

  Render graph from [GIBS](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/GIBS/GIBS+Available+Imagery+Products) onto an Earth model. It has two scenes. One scene renders 4 viewports of Earth for displaying the 3D model inside prism. The other renders 4 different graphs for displaying on projector. The application connects to **center-server** for receiving controlling messages from **Leap Motion** and **controller**.

2. **[LeapMotion](https://github.com/glass-earth/glass-earth/tree/master/LeapMotion)**

  Control the graphs using Leap Motion.

3. **[AstronomersAndroid (Controller)](https://github.com/glass-earth/glass-earth/tree/master/AstronomersAndroid)**

  Control the graphs using Android tablet. Supports NFC and gesture. This application allows teacher to select current lesson and control whole system. Students may tap their smartphone to open **web application** via NFC.

4. **[center-server](https://github.com/glass-earth/glass-earth/tree/master/center-server)**

  **Control server** connects other devices, manage state of whole system and forwards messages between **EarthModelUnity**, **Leap Motion**, **controller** and **web application**.

  **Web server** serves home page, **web application** and **api**.

  **Web application** for students to read lessons. This application connects to server via websocket and will display the current lesson. It will update content as soon as teacher changes current lesson by using **controller**.

  **API server** at /wmapi/

5. **[gibs-data](https://github.com/glass-earth/glass-earth/tree/master/gibs-data)**

  Download and process data from GIBS service. More information: [github.com/glass-earth/glass-earth/tree/master/gibs-data](https://github.com/glass-earth/glass-earth/tree/master/gibs-data)
